=head1 NAME

acap2pcap - convert Cisco ASA capture text to PCAP file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  acap2pcap [options] [filename]

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --help | -?

Show a short help text and exit.

=head2 --man

Show the full manual page and exit.

=head2 --dlt $data_link_type

Specify the data link type for the PCAP file.

=head2 --output

Specify the name of the PCAP file (default: I<< asa.pcap >>).

=head2 --startday $date

Specify the starting day of the capture as YYYY-MM-DD (default: today).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program reads a packet capture from the Cisco ASA and writes it to
a file in PCAP format.
To use it, you can start the C<< show capture >> command on the command line
interface and send the output to this program.

  ssh asa show capture $name dump | acap2pcap

If you saved the output of the C<< show capture >> command to a file,
you may instead give the name of the file as an argument to the program.

  acap2pcap $filename

=head2 ASA output

A typical packet capture on a Cisco ASA looks like the following:

  pix515# show capture test dump
  522 packets captured
   1: 21:24:38.629087 192.168.1.2 > 192.168.1.1: icmp: echo request

This output shows raw IP traffic without layer 2 headers.
To convert this to a readable PCAP file, you would choose the data link type
101 (see next section).

The program takes the timestamp from the first line of each packet and the
hex values from the following lines to create the packet header and buffer
for the PCAP file.

=head2 Data link type

The data link type defaults to 1, also named DLT_EN10MB.
You use this if the output from the ASA shows the Ethernet header,
that means the MAC addresses of the sender and receiver.

For ASA captures that only contain the raw IP traffic without link level
header please use data link type 101 (DLT_RAW).

Use the option C<< --dlt >> to change the data link type.

If you try to open the PCAP file with wireshark or tcpdump and it
complains about corrupt packets, try the other data link type.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 Can't open file $filename to read ASA capture output

You can either feed the ASA output via standard input or a file.
If you specify a filename, make sure that the file exists, and that it is
readable.
